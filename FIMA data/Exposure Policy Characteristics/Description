expo_pol.py
This script retrieves **exposure-related policy fields** for a given list of FEMA NFIP claim IDs and saves them to a CSV file.

Functionality:

* Reads claim IDs from an input file (one per line).
* Fetches the following fields from the **FEMA NFIP Redacted Claims API**:
  * `id`
  * `policyCount`
  * `state`
  * `totalBuildingInsuranceCoverage`
  * `totalContentsInsuranceCoverage`
* Handles large ID lists by chunking API requests (default: 25 IDs per request).
* Writes results to a CSV file, ensuring the header is included only once.

Usage Example:

```bash
python3 expo_poly.py --ids-file ids.txt --out exposure.csv --chunk-size 25
```

* `--ids-file`: Path to file containing claim IDs (one per line).
* `--out`: Output CSV filename (default: `exposure.csv`).
* `--chunk-size`: Number of IDs per API request (default: 25).

Purpose in Project:
Provides **policy exposure data**—such as insured amounts and policy counts—which is used in the claims modeling pipeline to normalize frequency/severity metrics and enhance risk state classification.
