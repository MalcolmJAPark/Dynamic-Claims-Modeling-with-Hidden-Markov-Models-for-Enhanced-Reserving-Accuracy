Temporal/Identification fields
- dateOfLoss: use to build time series (e.g., monthly counts), plot time series of # of claims per month (frequency)
- asOfDate: use for data-currency checks and to align "cut off" for reserving runs. Data-currency check to verify that this project will only work with claims data up through a known "asOfDate" so that we do not inadvertently work with insurance records that are not fully resolved. Reserving "cut offs" allow for us to treat anything after the "cut off" "asOfDate' will be taken as Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) which we can use to project reserves. Hence, our Hidden Markov Model (HMM) will train fully on observed data, increasing accuracy.
- id: unique record key to prevent duplication.

Exposure/Policy Characteristics
- policyCount: use as proxy to measure exposure in each period (i.e., number of active policies in force each period)
- state: provideds geographic segmentation (for stratified HMM structure but this will take much longer - train an HMM model per geographic location), due to heterogeneous risk profiles (some states are known to flood more easily than others) and the notion that each location has its own flood-zone distribution, building practice, elevation differences, and local mitigation efforts.
- totalBuildingInsuranceCoverage & totalContentsInsuranceCoverage: indicates exposure size to normalize severity, scatter plot of coverage amount vs. claim severity

Structural/Risk Indicators
- ratedFloodZone: zone classification correlates strongly with claim magnitude --> more severely rated zones have high degree of insurance claims, plot boxplot of claim severity by flood zone.
- elevationDifference: Depth of first flood entry above Base Flood Elevation (BFE, computed elevation to which floodwater is anticipated to rise during 1-percent-annual-chance flood event); a continuous risk factor, plot Density/histogram of elevationDifference for paid claims.
- postFIRMConstructionIndicator: Construction vintage influences risk; use as a covarite
- primaryResidenceIndicator: Occupancy type (primary vs. secondary) to explain claim frequency.

Claim Severity Fields
- amountPaidOnBuildingClaim
- amountPaidOnContentsClaim
- amountPaidOnIncreasedCostOfComplianceClaim
- netBuildingPaymentAmount & netContentsPaymentAmount:
  * combine to total paid = building + contents + ICC
  * plot histogram of total paid; log-scale density for heavy tails - distribution has heavy tails when its prob of very large (or small) values decays slower than in the familiar thin-tailed families (ex. normal)

Difficult to deal with Null values in entries --> Drop id entries with null in row of columsn that are used for HMM model design.
Time index: dateOfLoss
Claim identifiers: id
Frequency: derived count
Severity: netBuildingPaymentAmount, netContentsPaymentAmount
Exposure: policyCount (± coverage columns)
Covariates (if you’ll condition on them): state and structural indicators
Cut-off control: asOfDate (for preprocessing only)

In practice, our HMM input at each time step t could be a vector s.t.
O_t = (#claims_t (from id, dateOfLoss), S_bar_t (avg severity from netPayment), policyCount_t (exposure), optional covariates)
