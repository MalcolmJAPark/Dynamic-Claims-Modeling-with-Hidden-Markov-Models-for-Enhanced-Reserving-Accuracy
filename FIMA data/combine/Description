combine_data.py
This script merges multiple FEMA NFIP claims CSV datasets into a single combined file for modeling and analysis.

Functionality:

* Reads claim IDs from `my_ids.txt` (one UUID per line).
* Filters four datasets to include only those IDs:
  * `subset_claims.csv` (date-related fields)
  * `exposure.csv` (policy exposure data)
  * `structural.csv` (structural/risk attributes)
  * `severity.csv` (claim payment amounts)
* Merges datasets sequentially using **left joins** to preserve all IDs, even if some datasets are missing information for them.
* Saves the merged dataset as `combined_data.csv`.

Usage Example:

```bash
python3 combine_data.py
```

Purpose in Project:
Consolidates the separate data retrieval outputs into one structured dataset, enabling downstream analysis and Hidden Markov Model fitting without repeated joins or filtering.
