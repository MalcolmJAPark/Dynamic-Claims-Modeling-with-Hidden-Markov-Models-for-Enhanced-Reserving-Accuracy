analyze_time_series.py
This script performs **exploratory analysis** on the quarterly aggregated claims dataset, computing summary statistics, detecting outliers, and visualizing time series trends and seasonal patterns.

Functionality:

1. **Load & Prepare Data**

   * Reads the quarterly aggregated dataset (e.g., `aggregated_quarterly.csv`).
   * Parses `quarter_start` dates and sorts chronologically.

2. **Summary Statistics**

   * Calculates mean and variance for:

     * `n_claims` (quarterly claim counts)
     * `avg_log_severity` (average log severity of positive claims)

3. **Outlier Detection**

   * Uses **z-scores** (`|z| > 3`) to detect quarters with unusually high/low values for claim counts and severity.
   * Prints the list of outlier quarters.

4. **Time Series Visualization**

   * **n\_claims**:

     * Plots quarterly counts with a 4-quarter moving average.
     * Highlights detected outliers.
     * Saves plot to `n_claims_time_series.png`.
   * **avg\_log\_severity**:

     * Plots quarterly average log severity with a 4-quarter moving average.
     * Highlights detected outliers.
     * Saves plot to `avg_log_severity_time_series.png`.

5. **Seasonality Analysis**

   * Groups data by **quarter of year** (1â€“4).
   * Plots average values for:

     * Claim counts (`n_claims_seasonality.png`)
     * Average log severity (`avg_log_severity_seasonality.png`)

Usage Example:

```bash
python3 analyze_time_series.py
```

(Default input: `aggregated_quarterly.csv`)

Purpose in Project:
Provides **initial statistical insight and visual diagnostics** before fitting the HMM, helping identify:

* Outliers that may distort model fitting
* Long-term trends in claims
* Seasonal patterns that could influence state transitions
